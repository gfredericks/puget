(defn rank
  "Comparator function that provides a total ordering of EDN values. Values of
  different types sort in order of their types, per `type-priority`. `false`
  is before `true`, numbers are ordered by magnitude regardless of type, and
  characters, strings, keywords, and symbols are ordered lexically.

  Sequential collections are sorted by comparing their elements one at a time.
  If the sequences have equal leading elements, the longer one is ordered later.
  Sets are compared by cardinality first, then elements in sorted order.
  Finally, maps are compared by their entries in sorted order of their keys.

  All other types are sorted by class name. If the class implements
  `Comparable`, the instances of it are compared using `compare`. Otherwise, the
  values are ordered by print representation."
